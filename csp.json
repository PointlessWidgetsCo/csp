            "Description": "Cyber security incidents are consistently ranked by experts in the top five among all the risks impacting organisations globally. Cyberattacks are on the rise and are felt across all the sectors of our society, in particular government, banking, insurance, telecommunications, entertainment, automation, and artificial intelligence. This situation is compounded by a worldwide shortage of expertise, a cyber security skills gap which represents as many as 3.5 million unfilled jobs in cyber security globally by 2021. The influx of new graduates in this emerging field will not be enough to match the demand and close this gap. There is a great opportunity for workers in Australia and around the world to upskill in cyber security and embark on a journey of continuous learning to keep organisations safe from cybercriminals and cyber threats. The Graduate Certificate in Cyber Security offered online by the University of Wollongong provides a foundation for a successful career in cyber security. By learning coding, database security, web security and cyber security risk management, Bachelor graduates in any discipline quickly gain vital knowledge and skills, which are in high-demand in roles such as secure software developer, database administrator, secure web developer or security analyst.",

It embraces traditionally separate fields including human medical health disciplines, veterinary medicine, public health and health administration, and the interactions of human and animal populations with the environment. Although articulated as a 21st Century concept, the connection between human health and the environment has been understood since ancient times. The subsidiary concept of ecosystem health, which notes that healthy ecosystems are needed to support healthy communities, developed during the 20th Century. The modern synthesis is the recognition that complex health problems such as disease pandemics cannot be prevented or controlled by specialists in one discipline alone, but require contributions from multiple specialists working in collaborative teams.",

The course includes coursework, practicum, and research components. The objective of the Course is to prepare clinical psychologists who are skilled to work with clients across the lifespan- children, families and adults, and can apply a variety of models and skills to prevention, research, and evaluation at the individual and system levels. There is also an expectation that graduates will have demonstrated their research abilities by undertaking a major research project of clinical relevance.Murdoch is home to the Murdoch Psychology Clinic, which is a busy training and research facility serving the needs of the local community. The course includes in-depth training in clinical assessment and psychological therapies integrated with both a specialist child psychology and an adult psychology clinic which serve as as research and training facilities.In the second year of their studies candidates undertake approved external placements in collaboration with the Commonwealth and State Public Services, such as the Department of Health, Department for Community Development, Department of Justice, Disability Services Commission, WA Police Service and other public and private services and facilities in Western Australia.

This applies to advances in genetics and genomics as well as the huge diversity of phenotypic data being generated, related to everything from crop performance, the environment through to understanding and finding cures for human disease. There is a huge demand for individuals who have the skills to manage and interpret this flood of information. The field of bioinformatics has grown and evolved to meet this demand. Bioinformatics is a broad field, working across technologies with applied biological outcomes. Here the course provides the foundation in these broad areas of biology, with options to focus on the specific interests of the student, whether this be biomedical, environmental or agricultural. Because of this broad base, the course will be taught across schools, faculties and institutes, including hospitals and industry partners, to ensure access to the best expertise, providing students with training from researchers in their field of interest.  While there are a growing list of bioinformatics training resources, this course aims to differentiate itself by offering applied skills and training. The development of computational skills alone is insufficient to become a bioinformatics professional, but rather a deep understanding of the biology, combined with practical skills in handling large biological datasets is essential. Students will have access to a variety of data types to develop and hone their applied data analysis skills. The course is supported the Pawsey supercomputing centre, and students will have the opportunity to undertake projects in their area of interest with leading researchers and professionals in WA and beyond.",
